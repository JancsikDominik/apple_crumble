## Disclaimer: The only reason I wrote this is to learn, I don't condone cheating in a competetive environment.
## About the project
- My first attempt at making an external csgo cheat.
- The cheat is Windows (10) only
- I wouldn't use this as a starting point, the code structure is weird, and the code in general not very clean.

> __Warning__
> The cheat might be detected (at the very least glow and radar sure are)

## Usage
- Clone/download the repo, compile it and start the .exe while csgo is running.
- If it doesn't work try updating offsets with hazedumper/other tools, if it still doesn't work you're on your own, as I won't update it
